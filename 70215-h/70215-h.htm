<hr class="chap">

<p>The hopeful spires of the Friendship Tower, you will recall, rose
steadily, tier upon tier, throughout the year A.D. 4000 plus,
despite the fact that it was beginning, more and more, to resemble a
neoclassical stock exchange than it did a tower, and that the higher it
climbed, the lower sank the estate of diplomatic relations among its
backers, the nations of the Alliance of Inner Planets.</p>

<p>The Venusians wanted it on Venus because, as they shrewdly noted, Venus
is wide open; the vacationer's planet. Low taxes. Moderate building
costs, and a diverting variety of entertainment for the visiting
delegates when they should meet. Why the <i>derva</i>-girls alone—</p>

<p>Mars wanted it on Mars, because, they said, the world is centrally
located, easily accessible, and the dry climate was sure to preserve
the masonry of the Friendship Tower forever, an immortal monument to
man's amicability.</p>

<p>The Jovian colonials wanted it on Ganymede, because that would be most
convenient (for Jupiter), and the Ganymedians agreed, if Jupiter would
meet their share of the cost.</p>

<p>The kindest thing that can be said of the Saturnians, is that they were
exceedingly saturnine. They hadn't a chance, and they knew it. Everyone
expected trouble with Saturn.</p>

<p>Earth got it on Earth, with an overwhelming majority of one vote and
eighty-three million dollars.</p>

<p>The Friendship Tower spitted the occasionally-blue sky over Capitol
City in less than eleven months from the time its corner-stone was
laid, and waited in awesome emptiness for the first friendly meeting of
worlds within it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>If there was anyone who was completely satisfied with the Tower, it
must have been Christopher M. Berthold, who first sketched it with gilt
pen on a drawing board, and later drew it in bold lines of steel and
plastic on the green horizon of his mother Earth. But Chris Berthold
was a dour young man who had never in his life admitted that anything
satisfied him.</p>

<p>By no coincidence, the man who built the tower was one of the three
most famous architects in the solar system, at the age of only
thirty one, but he held the obsession, apparently, that this fame
was fleeting, that his public was a fickle group and might abandon
him at any moment, that he ought to keep his insurance up, and his
unemployment benefits in good standing, just in case. In short, the
hell with life, the gloomy old thing.</p>

<p>All this did not keep Camilla Reed from loving him. It merely kept
her at her distance. As a reporter for the <i>Gazette</i>, she had
known him publicly for five years. As the freckle-faced little girl
next door (remember?), she had been acquainted with his virtues and his
idiosyncrasies since childhood, and worshipped them.</p>

<p>The only thing was, Camilla was still freckle-faced, and she had
not grown up into a ravishingly beautiful young woman, the way
freckle-faced little girls do in stories. Chris Berthold did <i>not</i>
grovel at her feet—in fact, he scarcely seemed to know that she was
alive—and nobody, so far, was living happily ever after. It was most
discouraging.</p>

<p>Girl reporters are supposed to be fascinatingly flippant. Camilla
often stammered through interviews. They are supposed to be vivacious,
with lovely red hair; she was quiet, diminutive, and her hair was
an indeterminate shade of brown. Reporters are supposed to be
ill-mannered, inconsiderate of the privacy of others, cocky, devilish.
Camilla was none of these.</p>

<p>That was the reason she often got into places no other newsperson
could, scooped ace reporters, and came away leaving a warm,
co-operative glow in the hearts of important people. And she didn't
even suspect it.</p>

<p>She was on hand, along with five hundred and seventeen other reporters
the day they opened the Friendship Building to the first Congress of
the Alliance. The other five hundred and seventeen reporters were
collaring the delegates as they arrived, pumping them dry of words, and
setting them free. Camilla was only looking for Chris Berthold.</p>

<p>She discovered him, at last, in the visitor's gallery, where he hadn't
any business to be. She sacrificed her seat in the reserved section,
tramped on three sets of toes getting out, and made for him like a
homing pigeon.</p>

<p>The mezzanine level was crowded. Fifteen acres of milling, pleasantly
buzzing humanity—and some of them not so human. She pushed her way
among them, wishing, for once, that she were six inches taller. She
had marked her course by a pillar, but now all pillars were beginning
to look alike. It was half an hour before she found him, leaning
against the railing, staring not at the boiling sea of humanity below,
but moodily at the domed roof.</p>

<p>"Hi!" she said.</p>

<p>He turned, recognized her with a faintly absent glare. "Hello, Cam.
What're you doing here?"</p>

<p>She repressed a desire to run her fingers through his hair. Darkly
exciting hair it was. "Covering," she said vaguely. "Imagine us running
into each other here. Why, you ought to be down there with the Vips.
The rest of them, I mean."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He snarled. "There's too many on the proscenium now. The flooring
will warp. I warned them about it." He grumbled at length about the
stinginess of the Government, and the cupidity of certain fly-by-night
contractors. It was a familiar tirade. She listened patiently until he
was finished. It didn't matter to Camilla what he talked about it. She
just loved to hear his voice.</p>

<p>"I think it's wonderful," she said. "I mean a place that will hold a
hundred thousand people. It's a shame that you can stand right here
among all these people, and nobody even recognizes you—the man who
built it."</p>

<p>"I like it this way," he said. "Supposing it falls down tomorrow. Then
where would I be?"</p>

<p>She started to laugh, and his look froze her. Camilla bit her lip. "I
don't see you around much lately," she said, desperately changing the
subject.</p>

<p>"I've been pretty busy."</p>

<p>"I know." A lag in the conversation. They watched the panorama below.
Loudspeakers were blaring out the names of the delegates as they
arrived.</p>

<p>The loudspeaker: "HIS EXCELLENCY, LORD CHANCELLOR OF MORDANA, THIRD
DISTRICT, MARS."</p>

<p>A red beetle-being, scarcely four feet tall, followed by a retinue of
twenty guards and assistants, scurried along the roped-off aisle to the
central council table.</p>

<p>"THE HONORABLE YUN BROOL, REPRESENTATIVE, SECTOR 263, JUPITER."</p>

<p>A dark-suited group of humanoids, faintly alien in aspect, walking
close together. They looked faintly disdainful of the proceedings.
Which was Yun Brool? They were identically dressed.</p>

<p>"You can bet the one in the middle is Brool," Camilla said to Chris.
"Jovians are always afraid of being assassinated."</p>

<p>"Umm," said Christopher Berthold, gazing suspiciously at a rubberneck a
few yards away, who showed every evidence that he was about to scratch
his initials in one of the pseudo-marble columns with his pen-knife.</p>

<p>"SEVERN ALON, TERRITORIAL CHIEFTAIN, IO."</p>

<p>"The Noble Experiment," Chris said, "Do they really think it will work?"</p>

<p>"What's that?" Camilla said. "Say, look! There's a funny one coming in
now."</p>

<p>His answer was drowned. "DR. GOR JEETL, ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF
FOREIGN RELATIONS, FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE DISTRICT, SATURN."</p>

<p>There was a lull of sound below, followed by a high-pitched song
of excitement. It had been rumored that Saturn would send no
representative to this meeting.</p>

<p>Dr. Gor Jeetl was alone, but it might have been remarked (as doubtless
it was many times) that he was quite a congregation by himself. He
appeared to be of Terran extraction, except that no Earthman of modern
times was ever so huge. He must have weighed more than the entire
Martian contingent.</p>

<p>Roughly eight feet in height, his girth was such that when he walked
it was like the progression of an out-sized balloon, all dressed in
loose-fitting blue uniform.</p>

<p>"What a bel—" Camilla said. "I mean, look at the size of him."</p>

<p>"Disgusting," said Chris.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Gor Jeetl, if he sensed the hostility in that gigantic meeting house,
gave no sign of it. Propelling his paunch agilely before him, he beamed
benignly upon them all as he made his way to the council table.</p>

<p>He took a seat—rather, <i>tried</i> to take a seat. It was impossible.
A hurried conference. They brought another quickly, without confining
arm-rests. He flowed onto it, gratefully.</p>

<p>The guards began to clear the main floor, boosting the crowd back
upstairs. It was almost time for the assembly to come to order.</p>

<p>But there was something not right here. Camilla sensed it. An
undercurrent of tenseness about the great table below. The look on
Chris's face. A wolf-like watchfulness. Chris always expected the
worst, she knew from hard experience, but this was something special.</p>

<p>"They're frightened," she said with sudden inspiration. "Why are they
frightened?"</p>

<p>Chris gave her a look of sour disapproval. "You're a reporter," he said
accusively. "If I tell you something, can you keep it under your hat
until the thing's done with?"</p>

<p>"Sure I can."</p>

<p>He didn't look at her. "There's a rumor going around among the
delegates," he said. "They say a bomb has been smuggled in. Nothing to
it, of course, but—"</p>

<p>"The Saturnians?"</p>

<p>He shrugged savagely. "How would I know?"</p>

<p>"Something <i>is</i> going to happen," Camilla said. "I feel it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Anyway, I only care about the building. Diplomats are a dime
a dozen."</p>

<p><i>This isn't like him</i>, Camilla was thinking. <i>He's always
predicting calamities, but now</i>—</p>

<p>"You could be killed here," he said, with no particular inflection.
"But I don't suppose you could be talked into leaving if you knew the
roof was coming down on your head?"</p>

<p>"What?" she laughed, "and have the city editor slit my throat?" But her
heart leaped. It had sounded almost as though he were just a little
concerned for her safety.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're right," he said after a moment. "Where were you
intending to have lunch?"</p>

<p>"N-nowhere in particular," she said eagerly.</p>

<p>"Don't eat here," he advised her glumly. "The vendomats are sluggish.
The heating coils are inadequate, and the selectors should have had
cadmium breakers instead of the cheap stuff. I designed it that way,
but you can't tell them anything. Well, I've got to be getting along.
See you later."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Telug Three-seven-gee, lately of Venus, was not so frivolous as his
brilliantly red comb made him appear. It arched his carapaced back
and stood stiffly erect upon his bald pate, like the plumed helmet of
ancient Greek warriors, quivering slightly as he endeavored to hear and
annotate everything that was said. He was Amanuensis Extraordinary to
his party, and his keen ears were highly trained.</p>

<p>He was the first to hear the ticking sound. It was not like the tick of
a watch. Subtly different. It was, however, rather like something else
he had heard once. But that could not be.</p>

<p><i>Could it?</i></p>

<p>Furtively he glanced around him. Over there sat the Martian delegation,
brilliant, cynical little creatures. Near them were the Earth men. And
on the other side, the black tunicked Jovians.</p>

<p>To his right was his own party. Nothing among them would make such a
sound, he was certain.</p>

<p>On Telug's other side sat the Saturnian representative, Dr. Gor Jeetl.
Dr. Jeetl sat tranquilly listening to the discourse of a hundred
diplomats with a fixed smile on his circular face. His abdomen rested
comfortably upon his knees, making a kind of dais upon which to place
his folded arms.</p>

<p>The ticking was coming from Gor Jeetl. It was extremely faint. No one
but Telug could have heard it.</p>

<p>Efficient secretary that he was, he immediately penned a note, folded
it twice, and passed it down to the leader of his party, Madong
Five-seven-ex. It might have noted that Telug's topknot had turned
quite pale.</p>

<p>Madong, resplendent in his custard-yellow suit, read the note. He
leaned over so that he could catch Telug's eye, past the three
Venusians that sat between them. Telug nodded gravely.</p>

<p>Madong pressed the red button in front of him, requesting audience. He
was recognized by the chairman.</p>

<p>Madong stood. His heavy lips felt dry. He licked them with bulbous,
blue tongue. "Mr. Chairman," he said, "the Venusian delegation
respectfully requests permission to withdraw from the assembly of
Friendship until further notice."</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman eyed him keenly. He was a shrewd Ganymedian. "May we ask
the reason for this request?"</p>

<p>"The Venusian delegation would rather not say."</p>

<p>An ominous ripple progressed around the table, affecting every person
except, perhaps, one Gor Jeetl. He was gravely contemplating his silver
belt buckle.</p>

<p>"Obviously," the Ganymedian chairman said, "we cannot permit the
gentlemen from Venus to leave unless they consent to explain their
action."</p>

<p>Madong, emissary of Venus, sprang up with apparent agitation. He
started around the table, heels clicking loudly on the floor. It seemed
that it required fifteen minutes for him to circumnavigate that huge
circle, but it could not have been half so long.</p>

<p>He whispered in the chairman's ear.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" the chairman said, louder than he had intended.
Everyone jumped. Almost everyone.</p>

<p>Madong nodded in a positive fashion.</p>

<p>The chairman rapped with his gavel. "We will take a recess," he said.
"Fifteen minutes." He turned and whispered to two khaki-clad Terran
guards.</p>

<p>The delegates sprang up willingly, milled about, chattering among
themselves as they left the conference area.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Arising was quite a problem for Dr. Gor Jeetl. He had no arm-rests on
his chair, you will recall, on which to brace his hands. Nevertheless,
he was sure that he could make it. He turned sidewise on his inadequate
seat, placed one hand on the back of his chair and made a heroic
effort. Nothing happened. A heavy weight on each shoulder was holding
him down.</p>

<p>Two white-gloved clad hands. He looked up with some surprise into the
faces of the two guards.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest trace of compassion there. Two gendarmes
<i>sans merci</i>.</p>

<p>The Captain of the Friendship Tower Guards was a fearless, red-faced
man. Captains of the Guard are always red-faced and fearless. He
spitted the Assistant Commissioner of Foreign Relations of Saturn with
his gimlet eye, an impressive man who knew the overwhelming weight of
his own personality.</p>

<p>The gallery was silent. The people knew that something extraordinary
was going on, so they quelled the normal impulse to discuss it in order
to satisfy that strongest of human yearnings. If they were quiet there
was a bare possibility that they might <i>hear</i> something. The Word
was not yet in the air. When it came they would change from rational
beings into a huge, slavering beast—a mob. But the time was not yet;
the beast lay hidden.</p>

<p>Gor Jeetl appeared mildly curious as to the reason for this sudden
surplus of attention with which he was being deluged.</p>

<p>"Why am I held, Captain?" he asked. "It seems most inhospitable, to say
the least. Think what this may do to the relations between our worlds,
yours and my native Saturn."</p>

<p>"We have already thought of that," the Captain said.</p>

<p>"You have?" said Dr. Jeetl, surprised.</p>

<p>"Come, come," the Captain said. "The game's up. We know all about you,
Fatty. One of the Venusian party heard the ticking."</p>

<p>Gor Jeetl turned crimson throughout the vast expanse of his sagging
jowls and three chins. "So you know!" he breathed. "I shall report your
rudeness, nonetheless."</p>

<p>"Sure. Do that. Meanwhile, just where <i>is</i> it? You were scanned
when you came in, along with everyone else."</p>

<p>"Here, of course," said Gor Jeetl, placing a hand upon his stomach with
dignity. "Clever of them, and most convenient, I will admit, though I
have loathed the knowledge. If only—"</p>

<p>The Captain laid his ear to the vast expanse of stomach. His eyes
widened. "Incredible," he said. "When is the—the machine set for?"</p>

<p>"I see no harm in divulging that now," Dr. Jeetl said. "It is timed for
Earth noon."</p>

<p>"You see no harm—you see no—!" The Captain tried to laugh, and
strangled on it. He looked like a man reprieved from the grave.
"There's time, you imbecile! Supposing we spirited you out of
here—dropped you in the ocean?"</p>

<p>"Please!" Dr. Gor Jeetl smiled wanly. "The mechanism is extremely
delicate. You are likely to upset it talking of such unpleasant things."</p>

<p>The Captain of the Guards blanched. "You are saying that we dare not
move you?"</p>

<p>"It would be hazardous."</p>

<p>The Captain took out a tiny instrument and waved it like a wand over
Gor Jeetl's middle. The pinpoint light on the gadget blinked rapidly.</p>

<p>"Radiation," he said. "It's worse than we thought."</p>

<p>"Such a thing—<i>inside him</i>?" an assistant asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"Of course. Don't you see the diabolical cleverness of the Saturnian's
choice. Inside him, there'd be room for a whole armoury."</p>

<p>"It was the only practical thing," said Gor Jeetl, with quiet
bitterness.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing to do," the Captain of the Guard said,
"and that is to clear the area at once. Rogers, you will inform the
Superintendent, and also the platoon leader on the gallery floor. I'll
take care of things here."</p>

<p>But his last words were lost in a savage roar that grew into a tornadic
fury of sound, filling the hall, battering at their ears, threatening
sanity.</p>

<hr class="chap">

  <div class="caption">The crowd had the Word, and had become a beast.</div>
</div>

<hr class="chap">

<p>For someone had been indiscreet. The crowd had the Word, and had become
the beast.</p>

<p><i>Bomb!</i></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was exactly 11:18 when they broke. In the history of that decade
there had been no comparable disaster. Nine died. Thousands were
injured. They poured down the spiral causeways like the flood of spring
rains over a dam, and it was said later that only the superb designing
job of the architect, Christopher Berthold, prevented casualties from
being much higher.</p>

<p>It required twenty minutes to clear the building. It would have taken
six, if it could have been done in orderly fashion.</p>

<p>The police were to clear the sector of the city for three miles in each
direction. There was no need. No citizen stopped running half so near
as that. Of course, later on, when the panic had subsided, the streets
had to be roped off and guarded to prevent them from trooping back,
for fear they might miss something. That was human nature, and to be
expected.</p>

<p>The diplomats were herded, with diplomacy, into the Grand Solar Hotel
in another part of the city, and closely guarded. The Friendship Tower,
looming whitely against the skyline, was suddenly vacant.</p>

<p>Well, almost vacant. In the great meeting hall, at the table which
dwarfed even his respectable figure, sat the delegate from Saturn, Dr.
Gor Jeetl, obediently following the orders of Terran authorities. He
was the merest speck in the vast place, and if there had been any there
to see, they would have noted a stolid determination in the set of his
mouth—the look of a dedicated man.</p>

<p>For, after all, it had been Saturn's plan, people said, merely to
destroy the building; the destruction of ten thousand beings had been,
in itself, incidental, it it had occurred. The fission bomb planted in
Gor Jeetl's belly through some incredible operation would accomplish
its purpose, and there was nothing anyone could do about it.</p>

<p>The City Fathers had gathered on a rooftop, five miles away, to watch
the destruction. Some of the most important men on Earth were there.
Observation wings cautiously shied around the area, taking last
pictures, waiting for the grandest shot of all.</p>

<p>Some felt sorry for Chris Berthold, the man who had spent five years
designing the Friendship Tower. But Berthold was not there. He had
other things on his mind.</p>

<p>He had been a third of the way around the blockaded area when he
discovered his first clue. He tried to run the barricade. The guard had
his job to do. He saw only a hatless, wild-eyed young man with a sandy
crew-cut, trying to commit suicide.</p>

<p>"Halt," he said.</p>

<p>"Have you seen a girl come out of here?" Chris said. "Golden-brown
hair. Blue eyes. Blue suit. Black shoulder bag. Think!"</p>

<p>The guard shook his head. "Comin' out—no. Not more'n five hundred
that meet that description, I'd say. Are you crazy or something?
Say—there was one tried to get through here a minute ago that fits
that description to a "T." I wouldn't let her in. The whole place is
due to blow any minute, or didn't you know?"</p>

<p>"Trying to get in? But that wouldn't have been Camilla. Even a
newspaperwoman would have better sense."</p>

<p>"She was nuts," the guard said. "She was crying and saying something
about they couldn't blow up the Friendship Tower after this guy had
worked so hard on it, and she was going to stop it."</p>

<p>"She got out and went back!" Chris said. "Good God! And it's only
fifteen minutes to twelve. She must've gotten through somewhere."</p>

<p>"Somewhere, hell!" the guard said. "She got through here. She—"</p>

<p>"But I thought you said you wouldn't let her in?"</p>

<p>"She got past me. What you want me to do, shoot her in the back? You
think I was going to run in there after her? You think—"</p>

<p>Christopher Berthold, who had never so much as shoved a fellow human
being in his life, struck the guard with a large, enthusiastic fist,
just over the left eye. The guard, unprepared, went down and stayed
down. Chris took the squad car, parked at the curb, and roared off in
the direction of the Tower. The guard said later that there had been a
maniacal glint in his eye.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She had gotten through, all right. He saw her legs twinkling up those
eighteen broad steps—one for every member planet and satellite nation
of the Friendship Alliance. She was running.</p>

<p>It was exactly four minutes until twelve by his watch. He ran after
her, sick with the knowledge that he must be too late.</p>

<p>There in the portal he caught her arm. Her cheeks were tear- and
grime-streaked as she turned, startled, to face him. Her hair was in
disarray. But she was beautiful, and she had never been beautiful
before.</p>

<p>"This is a fine fix you've got us in," he said.</p>

<p>"I couldn't bear to see it go. The only thing you ever l-loved. Your
life work. Oh, I knew how you felt, despite the fact that you always
grumble so."</p>

<p>"You're crazy," he said dully. "Completely crazy. Do you think I'd
trade your life for a building? Stop crying and come on; it's too late
to turn back now. We've got to stop the madman if we can."</p>

<p>They hurried, and the empty Tower, silent as a cathedral, mocked them
with the echoes of their pounding feet.</p>

<p>In the center of the rotunda, the big table, where men were to have met
as good neighbors, glistened in the light from the transparent door,
more than a quarter of a mile above.</p>

<p>Gor Jeetl, the Saturnian, was still sitting where the world had left
him.</p>

<p>He greeted them with a grave nod. "Why have you come back?" he said.
"Never mind answering. The world is full of madness today."</p>

<p>"Listen," Chris said, "the contrivance is supposed to go off in three
minutes. Isn't there any way you can delay it until this girl is in the
clear. Surely you have nothing against her."</p>

<p>Gor Jeetl turned disillusioned eyes upon Camilla. "She is a lovely,
innocent girl," he said. "Almost a child, I can see that. I am
sorry—truly sorry that she must be here to witness my degradation. But
there is nothing I can do." There was a tear in his eye. "It will go
off at precisely twelve o'clock. I regret to say that the scientists of
Saturn build well."</p>

<p>"Then there's nothing more to do except wait," Chris said. He put his
arms about Camilla. It was never too late for some things. "Listen," he
said, "I want to tell you something."</p>

<p>"One minute and a half ..." Camilla said. And she was strangely happy,
because she had thought that Christopher's arm would never be around
her, even in death. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"I love you," he said. "Oh, I know I'm a heel, but I've got to say
it. So there. If only his damned ship had been blasted out of the air
before it got to Earth, things would have been different!"</p>

<p>Dr. Gor Jeetl looked shocked at the thought of inserting such a violent
emotion in this tender moment, for he was a romanticist, at heart.</p>

<p>"Half a minute," said Camilla softly, "Twen—"</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There was a soft, but clearly audible sound emerging suddenly from
somewhere within the cavernous depths of Gor Jeetl. A pleasant,
bell-like tone, like a sweet-voiced alarm clock. The Saturnian turned
his face away, and it was contorted with emotion.</p>

<p>"The warning signal," Chris said. "Goodby, darling." He kissed her. It
was quite an expert kiss for a young man more experienced in reading
decitrig slide rules. He intended that it should last until the end.
But he ran out of breath. It seemed quite a long time, and still
nothing had happened.</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>"Something is wrong," Camilla said.</p>

<p>But the curious expression was still on Gor Jeetl's face. Not fear; not
the anticipation of the end. Something almost like repugnance.</p>

<p>"You did not laugh," Gor Jeetl said. "For that I thank you." He waited,
while they stared in horrified expectation. "Oh, you need not stay any
longer," he said. "It is all over. My ignominy is complete now, is it
not? I am ready to go home."</p>

<p>Still no answer. "Wait a minute," said Chris after a moment, "just what
<i>is</i> it that's inside you? A belated light was dawning.</p>

<p>"Why you must know, of course. It is an artificial stomach. Many years
ago I had an ulcer. They removed my digestive system and installed a
mechanical thing in its place. There was no longer any hunger pangs to
warn me that I need nourishment, therefore the bell within me. I shall
never forgive them for that. I did not ask for it. I, Gor Jeetl, to be
embarrassed three times daily!" The Saturnian was frankly crying now.
He propped his chins on his belly and wiped his nose with his shirt
collar. "The ticking?" said Chris in an odd voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, it ticks a little now and then. It needs overhauling. If it hadn't
been for that accursed, long-eared Venusian! They jumped at the chance,
of course, to humiliate me! No one would have known, otherwise." He
slumped on the table, wracked with sobs. "That man's stomach should
bring shame upon his entire nation!" he blubbered.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand," Chris shouted in his ear, "We thought it was a
bomb. Everybody thought it was a bomb; that Saturn had determined to
blow up Friendship Tower just to spite Earth!"</p>

<p>Gor Jeetl looked up at him through small, bleary eyes. Uncomprehending
eyes. "Oh, my dear young man!" he said.</p>

<p>Chris turned away with Camilla. He could no longer trust himself to
speak.</p>

<p>"Poor fat man," said Camilla softly, and she could not suppress a
giggle.</p>

<p>"It's lunch time," said Chris. "The vendomat will be empty. Before
we go back to tell the others, we could get a bite to eat there ...
together."</p>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
